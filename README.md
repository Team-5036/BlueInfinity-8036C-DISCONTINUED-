The Idea of this system is that with a double joystick controller one of the joysticks
Will control one side of Wheels and the second will control the others.

To Access the Code files first create a local repository clone.

Then Download the Purdue Robotics Operating System(PROSe).
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/purdueros/]

Then using that select the "pros" folder in the repo as the Workspace.

Once there, you will be able to access all of the folders and files  that makeup Leviathons code.
 Go to the src folder and then opcontrol.c to find the Beowulf-TankDrive system along with any other control options.
 
 For Documentation on useing the functions based in the Prose IDE go to its doccumentation.
